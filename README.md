Some awful retro games were only a few tweaks away from being not awful.

This project aims to both help me learn game development and design for different genres and also have fun with pixel art!

## About

Re: NES Flops is a collection of reimagined retro games built in Godot 4. Each game takes inspiration from classic NES titles that had potential but fell short in execution, and reimagines them with modern game design principles and improved mechanics.

## Current Games

### Rocky and Bullwinkle Adventure

A 2D platformer featuring the classic cartoon duo in a bomb-throwing adventure!

**Features:**
- **Physics-based movement** with acceleration and friction
- **Comprehensive animation system** with skid and jump animations
- **Mid-air direction changes** for precise platforming
- **Bomb system** with multiple states (unarmed, armed, thrown_safe, exploding)
- **Strategic bomb throwing** with marker positioning and sliding physics
- **Simple Enemy AI** that throws bombs and maintains strategic distance
- **Semisolid platforms** for enhanced level design
- **Damage detection** separate from physics collision

**Controls:**
